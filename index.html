                <h2>Sleep-Outside</h2>
                <h3>Group Project</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Sleeping Outside is a E-Commerce website that aims to offer a wide range of outdoor sleeping products, including tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, and hammocks. The website provides a user-friendly shopping experience, thanks to its single-page application (SPA) architecture, which allows users to explore different products without the need for page reloads. The product data is retrieved from a server.</p>
            <h4>Front-End Technology Stack:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Vite: A build tool that supports fast and efficient asset bundling and development environment setup.</li>
                <li>HTML5 / CSS3</li>
                <li>Jwt-decode: A JavaScript library used for decoding JSON Web Tokens on the client-side.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Key Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Pages:</strong> The website has dedicated pages for tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, and hammocks. Each product category page provides a list of relevant products along with their images, descriptions, and prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Detail Page:</strong>  When a user clicks on a product from any category page, they are taken to the product detail page. Here, they can view more detailed information about the selected product, such as specifications, customer reviews, and related items.</li>
                <li><strong>Shopping Cart: </strong>Users can add products to their shopping cart, which displays the selected items and their total prices. Users can easily manage their cart contents and proceed to checkout.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication with JWT-decode: </strong>User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Upon successful authentication on the server-side, the server generates a JWT, which is sent to the client-side. The website uses the jwt-decode library to extract user information from the JWT and manage authenticated user sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Data Retrieval: </strong>The product information is fetched from the server using both GET and POST requests. GET requests are used to fetch product details for display on various pages, while POST requests are specifically employed during the checkout process. These POST requests are responsible for transmitting user's order information securely to the server for processing, enabling the website to handle large inventories efficiently and provide the most up-to-date product data.</li>
